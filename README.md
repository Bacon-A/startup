Simon Application

Reproducing the simon application has been a useful tool for learning proper HTML.
Notice the general grouping of head, then body. Within body we have a header, a main, and then a footer.
This format style should be useful for my application

Menu items as "li" should also work. Put navigation elements within a "nav".
  
To include Bootstrap in your application using NPM you would run the following from your console. 
npm install bootstrap@5.2.3

Make sure to keep the .css very well organized so as to be able to clearly see what is happening.
